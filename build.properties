project.description=The Singleton design pattern as an interface, an abstract class and a trait.
project.notes='* Fixed a bug with inheriting from a class thats using "SingletonTrait" ($instance was an instance of the base class and not of the subclass).
* A class using "SingletonTrait" can now declare a field "$instance" (the class member has been substituted with a local static variable).
* Formatted source code.
* Removed the underscore character "_" as a prefix from the fields.'
