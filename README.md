# FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/FlorianWolters/PHP-Component-Util-Singleton.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/FlorianWolters/PHP-Component-Util-Singleton)

**FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** is a simple-to-use [PHP][17] component that provides the *Singleton* (and *Registry of Singletons* a.k.a. *Multiton*) creational design pattern.

## Introduction

*Singleton* is a *creational* design pattern and defined as follows:

> "Ensure a class only has once instance, and provide a global access point to it."

-- E. Gamma, et al. Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented software. Westford: Addison-Wesley, 1995.

**FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** contains of two traits:

* The trait [`FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton\SingletonTrait`][23]: A generic implementation of the *Singleton* creational design pattern.
* The trait [`FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton\MultitonTrait`][24]: A generic implementation of the *Registry of Singletons* a.k.a. *Multiton* creational design pattern.

The generic implementations as traits make this component **reusable** (see the section **Features** below).

## Features

* Allows to pass parameters to the static *Creation Method* `getInstance()`. The parameters are passed to the `protected` constructor of the class using the component.
* Allows a number of unlimited classes to use the component.
    * A class which uses the [`SingletonTrait`][23] (or [`MultitonTrait`][24]) can still inherit from another class.
    * A class which extends a class using the [`SingletonTrait`][23] (or [`MultitonTrait`][24]) is a **new** *Singleton* (or *Multiton*). Therefore the component supports inheritance.
* Disallows cloning and serializing of a *Singleton* (or *Multiton*) instance.
* Disallows overriding of the methods `getInstance()`, `__clone` and `__wakeup`.
* Follows the naming conventions for the *Singleton* design pattern (offers a static *Creation Method* `getInstance()`).
* Artifacts tested with both static and dynamic test procedures:
    * Dynamic component tests (unit tests) implemented using [PHPUnit][19].
    * Static code analysis performed using the following tools:
        * [PHP_CodeSniffer][14]: Style Checker
        * [PHP Mess Detector (PHPMD)][18]: Code Analyzer
        * [phpcpd][4]: Copy/Paste Detector (CPD)
        * [phpdcd][5]: Dead Code Detector (DCD)
* Installable via [Composer][3] or [PEAR installer][11]:
    * Provides a [Packagist][22] package which can be installed using the dependency manager [Composer][3].

        * Click [here][21] for the package on [Packagist][22].
    * Provides a [PEAR package][13] which can be installed using the package manager [PEAR installer][11].

        * Click [here][9] for the [PEAR channel][12].
* Provides a complete Application Programming Interface (API) documentation generated with the documentation generator [ApiGen][2].

    * Click [here][1] for the current API documentation.
* Follows the [PSR-0][6] requirements for autoloader interoperability.
* Follows the [PSR-1][7] basic coding style guide.
* Follows the [PSR-2][8] coding style guide.
* Follows the [Semantic Versioning][20] Specification (SemVer) 2.0.0-rc.1.

## Requirements

* [PHP][17] >= 5.4

## Usage

The best documentation for **FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** are the unit tests, which are shipped in the package. You will find them installed into your [PEAR][10] repository, which on Linux systems is normally `/usr/share/php/test`.

## Installation

### Local Installation

**FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** should be installed using the dependency manager [Composer][3]. [Composer][3] can be installed with [PHP][6].

    php -r "eval('?>'.file_get_contents('http://getcomposer.org/installer'));"

> This will just check a few [PHP][17] settings and then download `composer.phar` to your working directory. This file is the [Composer][3] binary. It is a PHAR ([PHP][17] archive), which is an archive format for [PHP][17] which can be run on the command line, amongst other things.
>
> Next, run the `install` command to resolve and download dependencies:

    php composer.phar install

### System-Wide Installation

**FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** should be installed using the [PEAR installer][11]. This installer is the [PHP][17] community's de-facto standard for installing [PHP][17] components.

    pear channel-discover pear.florianwolters.de
    pear install --alldeps fw/Singleton

## As A Dependency On Your Component

### Composer

If you are creating a component that relies on **FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton**, please make sure that you add **FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** to your component's `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "florianwolters/component-util-singleton": "0.3.*"
    }
}
```

### PEAR

If you are creating a component that relies on **FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton**, please make sure that you add **FlorianWolters\Component\Util\Singleton** to your component's `package.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <required>
    <package>
      <name>Singleton</name>
      <channel>pear.florianwolters.de</channel>
      <min>0.3.1</min>
      <max>0.3.99</max>
    </package>
  </required>
</dependencies>
```

## Development Environment

If you want to patch or enhance this component, you will need to create a suitable development environment. The easiest way to do that is to install [phix4componentdev][16]:

    # phix4componentdev
    pear channel-discover pear.phix-project.org
    pear install phix/phix4componentdev

You can then clone the Git repository:

    # PHP-Component-Util-Singleton
    git clone http://github.com/FlorianWolters/PHP-Component-Util-Singleton

Then, install a local copy of this component's dependencies to complete the development environment:

    # build vendor/ folder
    phing build-vendor

To make life easier for you, common tasks (such as running unit tests, generating code review analytics, and creating the [PEAR package][13]) have been automated using [phing][15]. You'll find the automated steps inside the `build.xml` file that ships with the component.

Run the command `phing` in the component's top-level folder to see the full list of available automated tasks.
